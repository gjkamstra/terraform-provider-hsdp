# hsdp_iam_group
Provides a resource for managing HSDP IAM groups

## Example Usage

The following example creates a group

```hcl
resource "hsdp_iam_group" "tdr_users" {
  managing_organization = hsdp_iam_org.devorg.id
  name                  = "TDR Users"
  description           = "Group for TDR Users with Contract and Dataitem roles"
  roles                 = [hsdp_iam_role.TDRALL.id]
  users                 = [hsdp_iam_user.admin.id, hsdp_iam_user.developer.id]
  services              = [hsdp_iam_service.test.id]
}
```

This assumes a role definition exists example:

```hcl
resource "hsdp_iam_role" "TDRALL" {
  name        = "TDRALL"
  description = "Role for TDR users with ALL access"

  permissions = [
    "DATAITEM.CREATEONBEHALF",
    "DATAITEM.READ",
    "DATAITEM.DELETEONBEHALF",
    "DATAITEM.DELETE",
    "CONTRACT.CREATE",
    "DATAITEM.READONBEHALF",
    "CONTRACT.READ",
    "DATAITEM.CREATE",
  ]

  managing_organization = hsdp_iam_org.devorg.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the group
* `description` - (Required) The description of the group
* `roles` - (Required) The list of role IDS to assign to this group
* `managing_organization` - (Required) The managing organization ID
* `users` - (Optional) The list of user IDs to include in this group. The provider only manages this list of users. Existing users added by others means to the group by the provider. It is not practical to manage hundreds or thousands of users this way of course.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The GUID of the group

```
